# Electric-Vehicle-Data-Analysis-Project
In this project, We will analyze a dataset related to electric vehicles (EVs). The dataset contains
various features such as electric range, energy consumption, price, and other relevant
attributes. Our goal is to conduct a thorough analysis to uncover meaningful insights, tell a
compelling story, conduct hypothesis testing and provide actionable recommendations based on
the data.
